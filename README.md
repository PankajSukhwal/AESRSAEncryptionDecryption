# AESRSAEncryptionDecryption

Description :
Use AES and RSA to effectively encrypt/decrypt your data/payload using Dot Net Framework(v4.8 with backward compatibility upto v4.5.2-can be tested for lower versions).

Steps to run :
1. Set TestEncDec as your default project and run in Visual Studio.
2. Enter text to be encrypted for AES, you get the encrypted text with sufficient information and then decrypted data again to test if it works.
3. Enter text to be encrypted for RSA, you get the encrypted text with sufficient information and then decrypted data again to test if it works.

TechStack:
1. .Net Framework v4.8, C#

Uses:
1. You can individually use code files for AESCryptor or RSA Cryptor as per requirements.
2. AESCryptor/RSACryptor directly provides encrypt/decrypt methods to be used, basic configurations are used and can be updated if needed.
